# ttgo-lilygo

These commits are based on the lacking information on the TTGO lilygo LoRa modules. 
Please check the sourcecode! Normally you need to adjust your band. For The Netherlands, I've adjusted it to 868. Both modules successfull ping-pong to eachother.

## The module 

The module works with the ESP32-board. Before you can access it, you need to import it in the Arduino IDE:

Add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json to the boards-index. Of course you need to download the ESP32 in the IDE.

From there on, compile and upload the source....

Cheers!
